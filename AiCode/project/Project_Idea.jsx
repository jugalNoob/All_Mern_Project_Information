🛠️ Suggested First Project: “Email Reply Agent”

Flow:

📥 User pastes an incoming email.

🤖 Gemini (Text Generation) → generates polite reply.

✍️ User edits if needed.

📤 Optional: Function call to send reply via Gmail API.

Why this is great:

100% doable with Gemini free API.

Teaches you text generation, prompt control, and optional function calling.





📌 Best Gemini Features for an Email AI Agent
1. 📝 Text Generation ✅

👉 Best for:

Writing new emails (e.g. “Write a formal job application email”)

Replying to incoming messages

Rewriting or improving tone/style (formal, casual, persuasive, etc.)

Why it's ideal:

Email creation is purely a text-generation task.

Gemini can follow instructions like “Write a polite response to this email in 80 words”.

Fast, cheap, and works well with prompt engineering.

Example Prompt:

You are an email assistant. 
Write a polite and professional reply to the following email:

"Hi, can you send me the project report by tomorrow?"

The reply should confirm and offer help.


Gemini responds with:

Hi [Name],
Absolutely, I’ll make sure the project report is ready by tomorrow.
Please let me know if you'd like any specific details included.

Best,
[Your Name]

✅ Conclusion: → Text Generation is the primary feature for building email-writing or reply agents.
