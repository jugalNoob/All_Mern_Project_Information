1. How will you resolve conflict in Git?


Conflicts occur whenever there are multiple people working on the same file across multiple branches. In such cases, git won't be able to resolve it automatically as it is not capable of deciding what changes has to get the precedence.
Following are the steps are done in order to resolve git conflicts:
1. Identify the files that have conflicts.
2. Discuss with members who have worked on the file and ensure that the required changes are done in the file.
3. Add these files to the staged section by using the git add command.
4. Commit these changes using the git commit command.
5. Finally, push the changes to the branch using the git



2. What command helps us know the list of branches merged to master?

git branch --merged helps to get the list of the branches that have been merged into the current branch.
Note: git branch --no-merged lists the branches that have not been merged to the current branch


19. Can you tell the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git	GitHub
This is a distributed version control system installed on local machines which allow developers to keep track of commit histories and supports collaborative work.	This is a cloud-based source code repository developed by using git.
This is maintained by ‚ÄúThe Linux Foundation‚Äù.	This was acquired by ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù
SVN, Mercurial, etc are the competitors	GitLab, Atlassian BitBucket, etc are the competitors.


17. Can you give differences between ‚Äúpull request‚Äù and ‚Äúbranch‚Äù?

pull request	branch
This process is done when there is a need to put a developer‚Äôs change into another person‚Äôs code branch. 	A branch is nothing but a separate version of the code.


16. Differentiate between git pull and git fetch.


14. What differentiates between the commands git remote and git clone?




13. What is the command used to delete a branch?
To delete a branch we can simply use the command git branch ‚Äìd [head].
To delete a branch locally, we can simply run the command: git branch -d <local_branch_name>
To delete a branch remotely, run the command: git push origin --delete <remote_branch_name>
Deleting a branching scenario occurs for multiple reasons. One such reason is to get rid of the feature branches once it has been merged into the development branch.


12. Tell me something about git stash?
Git stash can be used in cases where we need to 
switch in between branches and at the same time 
not wanting to lose edits in the current branch.
 Running the git stash command basically pushes 
 the current working directory state and index to the stack for future use and thereby providing a 
clean working directory for other tasks.


7. What does git annotate command do?
This command annotates each line within the given file with information from the commit which introduced that change. This command can also optionally annotate from a given revision.
Syntax: git annotate [<options>] <file> [<revision>]
You can get to learn more about this command from the official git documentation here.



8. What is the difference between git stash apply vs git stash pop command?


6. What is a detached HEAD and what causes this and how to avoid this?

3. Can you tell something about git reflog?

1. What has to be run to squash multiple commits (last N) into a single commit?

6. What is the functionality of git ls-tree?
