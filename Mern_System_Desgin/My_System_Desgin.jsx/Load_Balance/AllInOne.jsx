1. Load Balancing

Definition: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server gets overwhelmed.

Use Case: Handling high traffic on a website like YouTube or Amazon.

Types: Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash.


Which Load Balancer is Best?

Small Websites / Blogs: Round Robin (simple & easy).

Mixed-Capacity Servers: Weighted Round Robin.

Real-Time Apps: Least Connections.

Session-Based Apps: IP Hash / Sticky Session.

High-Performance APIs: Least Response Time.

Global Apps: Geographic Load Balancer.


✅ Takeaway:

Real-time, stateful projects → Least Connections + Sticky Sessions

Stateless REST API projects → Round Robin / Weighted Round Robin / Least Response Time

You can even combine LBs: Use Least Connections for WebSocket servers and Round Robin for REST APIs in the same overall system.

| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Round Robin**                        | Requests are distributed **evenly in order**, one by one.             | Small websites, blogs                         | Simple, easy to implement                           | Ignores server capacity, long-running requests can overload a server | Small/medium traffic, servers with similar capacity        |
| **Weighted Round Robin**               | Servers get requests based on **weight** (powerful servers get more). | Websites with servers of different capacities | Uses server capacity efficiently                    | Slightly more complex than simple Round Robin                        | Mixed-capacity servers                                     |
| **Least Connections**                  | Sends request to the server with **fewest active connections**.       | Real-time apps (chat, streaming)              | Balances load even when requests take variable time | Needs tracking of active connections                                 | Long-running requests, real-time systems                   |
| **IP Hash**                            | Chooses server based on a **hash of client’s IP**.                    | Shopping carts, session-based apps            | Ensures client always goes to same server           | Not flexible if server fails                                         | Session stickiness, maintaining user sessions              |
| **Random**                             | Sends requests **randomly** to servers.                               | Testing, simple setups                        | Easy to implement                                   | Uneven load distribution                                             | Small apps, test environments                              |
| **Least Response Time**                | Sends request to server responding **fastest** at the moment.         | High-performance APIs                         | Efficient, fast response                            | Requires constant monitoring                                         | APIs needing low latency                                   |
| **Weighted Least Connections**         | Combines weight + least connections                                   | Large, heterogeneous clusters                 | Efficient & smart load distribution                 | Complex                                                              | High-traffic websites with servers of different capacities |
| **Geographic / Global Load Balancing** | Directs traffic to **nearest data center**                            | Global services like Netflix                  | Reduces latency                                     | Needs global infrastructure                                          | Large-scale, global applications                           |



| **Type**                 | **How it Works**                                                                                          | **Example / Use Case**                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Round Robin**          | Requests are distributed **evenly in order**, one by one, to each server.                                 | Small web apps, simple websites. E.g., a blog with 3 servers: request 1 → server 1, request 2 → server 2, request 3 → server 3, then repeat. |
| **Least Connections**    | New requests go to the server with the **fewest active connections**.                                     | Real-time apps like chat apps or streaming services where some requests take longer.                                                         |
| **IP Hash**              | Server is chosen based on a **hash of the client’s IP**. Ensures the same client goes to the same server. | Shopping carts or session-based apps where user session data should stay on one server.                                                      |
| **Weighted Round Robin** | Servers get traffic based on a **weight** (powerful servers get more requests).                           | Websites with servers of different capacities.                                                                                               |
| **Random**               | Requests are sent to servers **randomly**.                                                                | Simple load distribution, testing environments.                                                                                              |



Mapping Load Balancer Types to Horizontal Scaling

| **Load Balancer Type**       | **Horizontal Scaling Use**                   | **Notes**                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Round Robin**              | Stateless servers (web servers, API servers) | Simple distribution; works well when all servers have similar capacity                                         |
| **Weighted Round Robin**     | Mixed-capacity servers                       | Gives more traffic to powerful servers; common in horizontal scaling with heterogeneous servers                |
| **Least Connections**        | Real-time, long-request servers              | Ensures new requests go to the server with the fewest active connections                                       |
| **IP Hash / Sticky Session** | Session-based apps (stateful)                | Ensures a client always hits the same server; useful when horizontally scaling servers that store session data |
| **Least Response Time**      | High-performance APIs                        | Horizontal scaling with monitoring; directs traffic to the fastest available server                            |
| **Geographic Load Balancer** | Global apps with multiple regions            | Directs traffic to the nearest data center; horizontal scaling across regions                                  |


Traffic Management = Load Balancer

The traffic management system decides which car goes on which road, similar to a load balancer.

| **Load Balancer Type**   | **Road Analogy**                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Round Robin              | Cars go to roads in order: Road 1 → Road 2 → Road 3 → repeat     |
| Weighted Round Robin     | Bigger roads get more cars                                       |
| Least Connections        | Cars go to the road with the least traffic jam                   |
| IP Hash / Sticky Session | Same car always takes the same road (session stickiness)         |
| Least Response Time      | Cars go to the road with the fastest travel time                 |
| Geographic LB            | Cars go to the nearest highway/road to reach destination quickly |


Yes, Node.js cluster can work as Round Robin, especially for HTTP requests.



1. Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)

Definition:

Adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single server to make it more powerful.

Use Cases:

Small to medium workloads.

When you want simplicity (no need to change the app for multiple servers).

Pros:

Simple to implement.

No need to manage multiple servers.

Cons:

There’s a hardware limit—you can’t scale forever.

If the server fails, the whole system goes down.

Example:

Upgrading a server from 8GB → 32GB RAM and 4 CPUs → handles more requests.

A small e-commerce site adding more RAM to the database server.

2. Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)

Definition:

Adding more servers to your system to share the load.

Use Cases:

High traffic apps, cloud-based apps, distributed systems.

Systems that need high availability and fault tolerance.

Pros:

Can scale almost infinitely by adding more servers.

Fault-tolerant: if one server fails, others handle the load.

Cons:

More complex to implement.

Requires load balancers, data partitioning, or replication.

Example:

Adding 3 more web servers behind a load balancer.

Netflix or YouTube adding servers in multiple regions to handle millions of users.
