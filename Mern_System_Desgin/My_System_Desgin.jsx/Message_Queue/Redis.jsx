Redis in Messaging / System Design
1️⃣ What Redis Can Do

Redis is an in-memory data store that can act as:

Cache → Fast key-value storage.


Message broker / Queue → Using lists, streams, or Pub/Sub.


Stream processor → Using Redis Streams.

2️⃣ Redis as a Queue / Pub/Sub
a) Redis Queue (List / LPUSH-RPOP)

How it works: Producers push messages to a list (LPUSH) and consumers pop messages (RPOP).

Use Case: Lightweight task queue, background jobs.

Pros: Fast, simple to set up.

Cons: No persistence by default (messages can be lost if Redis restarts).

b) Redis Pub/Sub

How it works: Producers publish messages to a channel; subscribers receive messages in real-time.

Use Case: Real-time notifications, chat apps.

Pros: Extremely fast, easy to scale horizontally.

Cons: Messages are ephemeral—if a subscriber is offline, it misses messages.




3️⃣ Redis Streams (Recommended for system design)

How it works: Persistent, ordered log of messages, similar to Kafka but in-memory.

Use Case: Event-driven microservices, real-time analytics, audit logs.

Pros:

Durable (can persist to disk if needed)

Consumer groups for parallel processing

Supports replay (read from any offset)

Cons: Not designed for extremely high throughput like Kafka at very large scale.



| Concept                | Best Use Case                              | Persistence                        | Delivery Guarantee                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Queue (RabbitMQ / SQS) | Task processing, async jobs                | Optional / Persistent              | At-least-once / exactly-once                 |
| Stream (Kafka)         | High-throughput, event sourcing, analytics | Persistent, replayable             | Exactly-once / At-least-once                 |
| Redis                  | Fast, lightweight messaging, caching       | Optional, Redis Streams persistent | At-least-once (Streams), ephemeral (Pub/Sub) |




5️⃣ When to Use Redis in System Design

Real-time dashboards or notifications.

Lightweight queues where persistence is not critical.

Event streaming in smaller-scale or low-latency systems using Redis Streams.

As a cache for high-speed lookups alongside a queue/stream system.

✅ Summary for System Design Interviews:

Queue (RabbitMQ / SQS) → Reliable background tasks.

Stream (Kafka) → Scalable event-driven / streaming pipelines.

Redis → Ultra-fast ephemeral messaging, small-scale streams, and caching.
