5. Architectural / Enterprise Patterns

These are higher-level patterns used in system design and microservices.

| Pattern                                             | Concept                                                             | Use Case                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**                     | Separate UI, business logic, and data.                              | Web frameworks (Rails, Spring MVC) |
| **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**                     | UI binding with data model separation.                              | Angular, WPF apps                  |
| **Event Sourcing**                                  | Persist state changes as a sequence of events.                      | Banking transactions, audit logs   |
| **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** | Separate read and write models.                                     | High-performance microservices     |
| **Saga Pattern**                                    | Manage distributed transactions via a series of local transactions. | Order processing, booking systems  |
| **Repository Pattern**                              | Encapsulate data access logic.                                      | ORM data layer abstraction         |
| **Dependency Injection**                            | Pass dependencies from outside rather than creating them inside.    | Spring, Angular apps               |
