These patterns deal with object composition and relationships to form larger structures.

| Pattern       | Concept                                                                        | Use Case                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Adapter**   | Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.        | Legacy system integration             |
| **Facade**    | Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.                         | Payment processing API facade         |
| **Proxy**     | Provide a placeholder for another object to control access.                    | Lazy loading, caching, access control |
| **Decorator** | Add responsibilities to objects dynamically without modifying their structure. | Adding features to UI components      |
| **Composite** | Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.                           | File system (file & folder)           |
| **Bridge**    | Decouple abstraction from implementation so they can vary independently.       | Cross-platform UI toolkit             |
